## MemMachine Installation Guide

This guide will walk you through the process of installing MemMachine. We'll start with the prerequisites you need to get set up, followed by two different installation methods.

<Steps>
<Step title="Gather Your Prerequisites">

Before you install the MemMachine software itself, you'll need to set up a few things. Be sure to note down any passwords or keys you create, as you'll need them later.

### A. Core Software

- **Python 3.12+**: MemMachine requires Python version 3.12 or newer.
- **PostgreSQL**: You will need a local PostgreSQL instance with the `pgvector` extension. You can find installation instructions on the official [PostgreSQL Downloads page](https://www.postgresql.org/download/). Once installed, create a new database and a user with full privileges for that database.
- **Neo4j**: A Neo4j database is required.  You can find installation instructions on the official [Neo4j Documentation page](https://neo4j.com/docs/). After installation, start the Neo4j server and set a password for the default `neo4j` user.

### B. Accounts and Keys

- **OpenAI API Key**: You will need an OpenAI account to use MemMachine. You can sign up on the [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/). You'll need to generate and copy your **API Key** for a later step.

<Note> MemMachine itself is free to install, but please be aware that using the software consumes tokens from your OpenAI account.</Note>

</Step>
<Step title="Choose Your Installation Method">

You can install MemMachine using a Python package manager or by cloning the source code from our GitHub repository.
<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Option 1: Install with Pip">

This is the recommended method for most users who want to add MemMachine to an existing Python environment.

To create a python environment(if it does not already exist), you can use `venv` as follows:
```sh
python -m venv memmachine-env
source memmachine-env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `source memmachine-env/Scripts/activate`
```

A. Run the following command in your terminal:

 - If you are using MemMachine in a CPU-only environment, use:
```sh
   pip install memmachine
```
 - If you have an NVIDIA GPU and want to leverage it, use:
```sh
pip install memmachine[gpu]
```
B. Next, install dependencies from NLTK through the following MemMachine command:
```sh
memmachine-nltk-setup
```
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Option 2: Install from Source (GitHub)">

This method is for users who want to contribute to the project or run from the latest source code.

First, clone the repository and navigate into the project directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/MemMachine/MemMachine.git
cd MemMachine
```

Second, Ensure you have a python environment set up. You can use `venv`, `conda`, or any other environment manager of your choice. 


Next, use the `uv` tool to install all dependencies. If you don't have `uv`, you'll need to install it first.

```sh
# If you don't have uv installed, run this command:
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Now, install the project dependencies:
uv pip install .
```
<Note> If you wish to run with an NVIDIA GPU, you will need to install dependencies for GPU by using the `uv pip install ".[gpu]"` command.</Note>

</AccordionGroup>
</Step>
<Step title="Create Your Configuration File - `cfg.yml`">

MemMachine uses a single configuration file, `cfg.yml` to provide login and options to it.

Create a file named `cfg.yml` in the same directory that you plan on running memmachine from. This file configures the various models and storage options for MemMachine.

There are two examples of `cfg.yml` files in the `sample_configs` directory of the GitHub repository: one for CPU-only installations and another for GPU-enabled setups. Be sure to choose the one that matches your environment.

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="CPU-Only Installations">
You can download this file from our GitHub repository as a template using the following curl command:
```sh
curl -o cfg.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MemMachine/MemMachine/refs/heads/main/sample_configs/episodic_memory_config.cpu.sample
```
Below is an example of what the CPU-only `config.yml` file should look like:

```sh expandable lines

  path: /tmp/memory_log
  level: info #| debug | error

  derivative_deriver: sentence

<Accordion title="GPU-Enabled Installations">
You can download this file from our GitHub repository as a template using the following curl command:
```sh
curl -o cfg.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MemMachine/MemMachine/refs/heads/main/sample_configs/episodic_memory_config.gpu.sample

Below is an example of what the GPU-enabled `config.yml` file should look like:

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
<Tip> 
You can name this configuration file whatever you like, then pass it to MemMachine using the `MEMORY_CONFIG` environment variable, like in the following examples:

 ```sh
 export MEMORY_CONFIG="/home/steve/wibble.cfg" # Sets the config file name
 memmachine # start memmachine
 ```

```sh
MEMORY_CONFIG="/home/steve/wibble.cfg" memmachine #defines the variable and starts memmachine
```
</Tip>
</Step>
<Step title="Run MemMachine">

You're ready to go! Run these commands from the directory where you've installed MemMachine.

First, you need to sync the profile schema. This is a **one-time** command that must be run before the very first time you start the server.

```
memmachine-sync-profile-schema
```

Now you can start the MemMachine server. If you have run MemMachine before, you can skip the sync step and go straight to this command:

```
memmachine-server
```

You should now have the MemMachine server running.

<Note> If you are using Docker to run your databases, ensure they are started and accessible before you try to start MemMachine.</Note>
